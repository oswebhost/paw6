<p style='font-size:10px;padding-top:8px'>Although we are far more accurate and consistent than most other prediction websites when it comes to soccer 1X2 betting, you will probably not be able to make money on "Results" betting unless you have a lot of information about how each team performed last season and is performing to date in the current season. 

<p style='font-size:10px;padding-top:8px'>However, unlike the data for the "UK Minor Divisions" free-of-charge postings, we do not provide you with the "Anticipated Score-Line" for the matches in the free-of-charge "Major Divisions" postings, because providing that data to Members is where we make our income from! 

<p style='font-size:10px;padding-top:8px'>To see the level of data we typically provide to subscribing Members (and which includes the "Anticipated Score-Lines", of course), please take a look at the Blue Square Premier "Free Predictions" PIC's (Performance Indicator Charts) and associated backup information, which also show the 1X2 Odds, plus the Odds for the 13 most common Correct Scores together with the Double Chance, Win Only (Draw = No Bet), Under/Over Odds and Asian Handicap Odds (where available). Just <b>click on the blue "Date/Time" link</b> to the left of each Fixture. 

<p style='font-size:10px;padding-top:8px'>You will see that, as a subscribing Member, you also get a ton of other useful data too, including score-line likelihood ratings, likely "goals advantage" data and other information that will help you considerably with your Correct Scores, Under/Over and Asian Handicap betting. Plus you will also get access to our weekly <b>Blank "EASE" Spreadsheets</b> and our weekend fully completed (done-for-you) "<b>EASE 6</b>" <b>Spreadsheets</b>.  


<p style='font-size:10px;padding-top:8px'>Our subscription charges are very small - <b>less than £1 per week</b> - whereas fulfilling your dream of hitting that Jackpot Soccer Win must be worth a great deal more to you than that!  

<p style='font-size:10px;padding-top:8px'>However, without our detailed prediction data you won't stand any chance on your own. This is because the Bookies are far too clever to lose regularly to Bettors who don't operate a proper Prediction/Selection System. But we do operate such Systems, which you can get access to for so very little. So help us to help you and subscribe right now to get access to our "Data for Members" area:
