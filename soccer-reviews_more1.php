   <p>If, like us, you are into Correct Scores betting, then Sunday’s Barcelona v Malaga match looks interesting.  So this email attempts to walk you through the “pros and cons” of the various betting options. 

<br /><br />Firstly, our “Predict-A-Win” Program has predicted the score-line will be 3-0, which is exactly what the Bookies think too.  How do we know that?  Well, the <strong>lowest Correct Score Odds being offered are 7.00</strong>, which just happens to be <strong>for the 3-0 score-line</strong>.

<br /><br />Next, for the Asian Handicap call, the Bookies are giving a <strong>2.75 goal advantage to Malaga</strong>, although they do suspect that Malaga may then have the overall advantage.  We can tell that from the respective AHC Odds on offer: Barcelona 2.00, whereas the Odds for Malaga are slightly lower (1.90).  

<br /><br />Of course, with the ¾ AHC bet type there are in fact 2 match results to consider, those being the handicapped result for: (1) the 2.50 goal advantage and (2) the 3.00 goal advantage (because the ¾ advantage is a “convention” only, of course).

<br /><br />So what does the Asian Handicap bet translate to here? 

<br />Well, if Barcelona does win 3-0, then you would win the bet where Malaga has only a 2.50 goal advantage, because the handicapped outcome would be 3-2.5 (no longer the straight 3-0 call).  On the other hand, the second part of the handicapped bet (for the half bet with the 3.00 goal advantage) would mean that the handicapped result is a Draw (3-3), so you would get your money back there (less the 6% Admin charge).  

<br /><br />If Barcelona were to win with greater than a 3 goal difference (4-0, 5-1, etc.), then you would win both halves of the bet and pick up a gross return of £2.00 for every £1.00 laid out.  And that would be a 100% profit!

<br /><br />But if Barcelona only ended up with just 2 goals more than Malaga, then you would lose the whole of your bet.  So what to do?

<br /><br />The main question here is this: Can Barcelona be relied upon to beat Malaga by at least 3 goals?  And to be able to answer that question we need to do some research.

<br /><br />Looking at our Program’s “Team Performance Records” for this match, you can see from the “Head-to-Head” records that Barcelona at Home has never lost to Malaga in the 8 matches played from 2001 until 2013!  In fact, out of those 8 matches only 3 of them have been with a win for Barcelona of less than 3 goals over Malaga.

<br /><br />Closer to date, out of the 9 Home venue matches played this season, Barcelona has won all of them, although only 5 matches showed a goal difference of at least 3 goals.  However, all 4 matches where the goal difference was less than 3 goals were when Barcelona was playing against teams that are currently in the top half of the table, whereas Malaga is sitting down at No. 15!    

<br /><br />Having said that, you should note that in all of the last 3 matches played, Malaga managed each time to get 1 goal against Barcelona!  The last 2 results both bore score-lines of 4-1!  Yes, that’s still a 3 goal difference, but would destroy a 3-0 Correct Score bet.


<br /><br /><strong>So what are the betting choices for this match?</strong>

<ol style="margin:0px"> <br />
    
    <li>The chances of the match being over 2.5 goals seem to be extremely high, because only once in the past 9 seasons has the Barcelona v Malaga match produced less (that was the 2-0 result in 2005-2006).  Similarly this season, 8 out of Barcelona’s 9 matches have produced score-lines of over 2.5 goals!  And what do the Bookies expect?  Well, the Odds tell all – only 1.25 is offered for the Under 2.5 goals call!  </li><br />
    
    <li>In ascending order, the Correct Score Odds on offer look like this: 3-0 (7.00), 4-0 (8.00), 2-0 (8.00), 1-0 (13.00), 3-1 (12.00), 2-1 (13.00), 4-1 (13.00), 1-1 (17.00) – and then the remaining possible calls offer ridiculously high Odds.</li> <br />
    
    <li>The Asian Handicap call for a Barcelona win seems a bit risky, although the Odds of 2.00 are very tempting.  You would need to be brave to risk that call.</li> <br />
    
    <li>If a Correct Score bet is being considered, it is obvious that the Bookies are not expecting a Draw, because the Odds on offer stand at 9.00!  So we would not bother putting money on a Draw score-line.  And neither are the Bookies expecting the match to produce under 2.5 goals, and there is nothing to make us suspect differently.  So, if we are ruling out the under 2.5 goals result, that means we would consider putting money on hedge bet score-lines of 3-0, 4-0, 3-1, 4-1 and, just in case the 2-1 also.  Then, as long as any one of those 5 comes in, even in the worst case we would win £2 for a £1 bet on each of those 5 matches.  </li>  <br />
    
    <li>Note that we would not go for the 1-0 or 2-0 calls, because we ourselves have decided that the match will not produce under 2.5 goals.  And we have chosen to totally ignore all the Away and Draw calls too.  Of course, we could be horribly surprised – but that’s the beautiful game for you – full of twists and turns!</li> <br />
    
    <li>A further hedge bet we will probably make, just to counter the fact that our Correct Scores betting might let us down, is to bet 10 times as much as we spend on the Correct Scores on the Over 2.5 goals call.  How will that work?  Well suppose we put £1 on each of the 5 Correct score calls but they all fail, then we will lose £5.  So if we also put £50 on the Over 2.5 goals call and it comes in at the given Odds of 1.25, then we will make £62.50, meaning that on the total bet of £55 we will have made a profit of £7.50 (that is, 13.63% profit).  But if even the lowest pay-out Correct Score call comes through (giving a return of only £7.00), then we will have made a profit of £19.50 on the £55 laid out (= 35.45%).</li> <br />
    
    <li>Of course, the more sensible thing to do may be to ignore the Correct Score hedge betting and the Under 2.5 goals call altogether and, instead, place all £110 on the outright win call which, if you are right, will give you a return of £121 (a profit of £11, which equates to a profit of 10%).  Less risk, but less gain, of course.</li>
