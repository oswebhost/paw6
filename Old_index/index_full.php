<h2>YOUR DREAM</h2>


<p>If your dream had been to <span class='bluei'>get rich through soccer betting</span>, then you already know by now that <span class='boldi'>standard 1X2 betting would never be able to help you achieve that goal!</span> Of course, if you really know your stuff then it is perfectly possible to earn a modest income from 1X2, just as I do. But a jackpot soccer win from 1X2? Forget it!</p>

<p><span class='blue'>Correct Scores betting</span> is a far better way for making really worthwhile money at soccer betting without risking a fortune, but <B>you will need solid, reliable data</B> to be able to get anywhere near a jackpot sized win.    </p>

<p>And <span class='blue'>that is where this website scores</span>, because <B>we give you all the Correct Scores soccer predictions data you will ever need</B> <span class='blue'>to help you fulfil your dream of landing that jackpot win!</span> </p>

<p>Our soccer predictions data is computer generated using the latest technology and employing the highest level of statistical integrity. That data is <B>completely unique</B> to this website, <B>saves you many hours of research</B> and offers you a <B>great return</B> for only a <B>very small investment!</B></p>

<p>In a nutshell, we make <B>weekly 1X2 predictions for 20 major European soccer Divisions</B> and give you access to our computer's <B>phenomenal array of solid backup data</B> <span class='bluei'>for less than £1 a week!</span> </p>

<p>But, we go that one step further and select <span class='blue'>6 special matches</span> we consider have the best chances of meeting our computer's projected score-lines which, if successful, would give us many <span class='blue'>high-paying lines of Correct Scores combination betting!</span></p>

<p>In conjunction with our sister website (<a class='sales' href='http://soccer-americas.com' target='_blank'>soccer-americas.com</a> - which covers prime Divisions in South America and North America - we provide <span class='blue'>a year-round service!</span> </p>

<p>Plus we give you full access to <B>our unique weekly</B> "<B>Express Advisory Selection System</B>" ("EASE" system for short), so you can easily find your own 6 special matches if you would prefer to do that! </p>

<p><b>We cater for the novice as well as the expert: </b></p>

<ul style="list-style-image: url(images/chk.gif);margin-left:20px;">
	<li style='padding-left:0px;'>For the novice, we do all the work and present our Correct Scores selections in a straightforward <span class='blue'>"quick-pick" style of report.</span> </li>
	
	<li style='padding-left:0px;'>For the expert, we provide <B>an abundance of graphs and tables</B> to allow them to drill down as deeply as they want to go inside the vast array of backup data we provide. You can choose for yourself just how deeply you wish to do your own research or how much you are prepared to rely on what we post.</li>

<H2>THE REALITIES OF 1X2 BETTING</H2>


<p>The problem with 1X2 betting is that if you want to make even a 5% profit in a week <B>gambling on</B> "<B>Favourites</B>", then you need to get at least 80% of your bets correct - <B>and many weeks you will need to be 100% right!</B> That's because the Bookies employ highly skilled personnel to make sure <B>it is impossible for the average Bettor to break the bank! </B> </p>

<p>Further, <B>1 Draw will probably occur in every 6 "Favourites" bets placed</B>, so achieving a 90% "hit rate" is very nearly impossible, <span class='redi'>and 100% successes week-after-week for a full season would be nothing short of a miracle!</span></p>

<p>If you are a novice, the consequence of this is that - <span class='bluei'>like millions of others in the same situation as you</span> - at the end of a season of "Favourites" betting your Starting Bank is probably <span class='boldi'>less than half of what you started with! </span> </p>

<p>Yes, for sure, <span class='blue'>even novices can have a lucky day or two!</span> And that's what drives most gamblers. But have all <span class='blue'><i>YOUR</i></span> past lucky days made up for the combined losses on the days your luck failed you?</p>

<p><B>It is possible to make money with 1X2 betting season after season,</B> but to do so you need to rise well above the level of novice.</p>

<p><span class='blue'>Having access to our predictions data dramatically turns the tide in your favour</span>, not just for 1X2 betting but for Correct Scores betting too!  </p>

<H2>THE DRAWBACKS OF 1X2 BETTING</H2>

<p>It's not hard to figure out where the problem comes in when trying to make a fortune with 1X2 betting. You put £10 on an "A" team to win at Home at Decimal Odds of 1.35, and it produces a 0-0 Draw; so you lose £10. The win call for that team's next match at Home carries increased Odds of 1.50, but <B>you would still have to lay out £20 just to recover the £10 you lost</B> on the previous match.  </p>

<p>I'm sure that scenario sounds all too familiar to you. And given that, overall, with Medium Odds, <B>Draws are the result of more than 1 in 4 matches</B>, the chances of you recovering your money after a major set-back are slim. So, with 1X2 betting, <span class='red'>most novices go on slowly losing more and more money to the Bookies each week! </span></p>

<p>However, as I intimated earlier, we all stand a chance of getting lucky on the day. <span class='blue'>So, when you do get lucky, you need to make sure it brings in a nice big fat win!</span> <b>Otherwise, what's the point of betting in the first place?</b>  </p>

<p>Well, since 1X2 betting wasn't ever able to make me rich on <span class='boldi'>my</span> lucky days, <B>Correct Scores betting</B> was the obvious choice for me. <span class='blue'>And, if you think about the matter deeply enough, you'll soon see it's right for you too!</span></p>

<H2>CORRECT SCORES BETTING v LOTTERIES</H2>

<p>One of the key things you will notice about the average soccer match is that <b>very few of the score-lines fall outside the range 0-0 to 6-6</b>. In fact, today, only about 1 in a 250 <span class='boldi'>doesn't</span> (meaning, of course, that 996 in every 1000 do). </p>

<p>Now, as it happens, <B>the number of combinations in that "average" range of score-lines is 49</B>, which is precisely the same as the numbers employed for most International Lotteries!  And that is no coincidence, I'm certain of it!</p>

<p>Because of the similarity in the number of winning chances between the two completely different gambling approaches (Correct Scores v Lotteries), we decided to take a more detailed look at how Lottery payouts compare to payouts for successful soccer Correct Scores betting combinations. And we unearthed <a class='sales' href="javascript:sele_win('interesting_fact.php');"> some very interesting facts</a> that clearly demonstrate how <span class='bluei'>Correct Scores betting hands-down beats a punt on the National Lottery.</span></p>

<p>Despite the fact that playing a Lottery is extremely unlikely to make you much money (if anything at all), please note that I'm not in any way advocating that you give up spending £1 (or even more) on your special numbers. Why? Because <span class='blodi'>you never know whose turn it is for the Gods to smile upon them this week</span>, and it could perhaps be you!</p>

<p>But what I do advocate is that you consider <span class='blue'>improving your chances more than 5-fold</span> of bringing in a worthwhile amount this week compared to a flutter on the Lottery, simply by taking £2 from what you were going to spend on 1X2 betting and spreading it across 10 alternative lines of Correct Scores for the same 6 matches at just 20 pence per line. </p>

<p>Then, if one of those 10 lines does come up, even just once, <span class='blue'>you will have made yourself close to £10,000!</span> And that's a substantial amount more than 99.9999% of those who play the Lottery will ever see in their entire life-time!</p>

<p>Now, if the above has you convinced that Correct Scores betting is the way to go without you needing to read any further, then please click on the link below and subscribe right now to gain access to our superb computer-generated predictions data.</p>

</div>

<H2>ATTRACTION OF CORRECT SCORES BETTING</H2>

<p>When you get a number of Correct Scores predictions right, the returns are exceptional! Even if the Decimal Odds are no higher than 6.00, <span class='blue'>a winning quadruple Correct Scores bet of £1 would give you a return of £1,296!</span> And on many occasions the Odds for a perfectly called combination are far higher than that.</p>

<p>So how can 1X2 betting possibly begin to compare with the money-making opportunities offered by Correct Scores betting? Quite simply, it can't! Added to which, <B>Correct Scores betting is far more fun!</B></p>

<p>That's why we recommend that, <span class='blue'>for potential big wins that won't cost you a fortune if they don't come through</span>, you seriously need to look at <B>Correct Scores betting!</B></p>

<p>With Correct Scores betting <B>we advocate spending a fraction of what you would on 1X2 betting!</B> Yes, compared to 1X2 wins the number of Correct Scores successes will be considerably reduced, that's true. But, when you do get a Correct Scores combination win, it will cover any earlier losses many times over. </p>

<p><i><B>Even if you don't manage to win a significant amount in a season with Correct Scores betting, if you are sensible about the amount you lay out then the amount you lose would be far less than the average seasonal losses you have been experiencing with 1X2 betting! </B></i></p>

<p>And at every step of the way <span class='blue'>you would have been far closer to making a killing</span> with Correct Scores betting than you ever could have been with 1X2 betting!</p>

<H2>BENEFITS OF CORRECT SCORES BETTING</H2> 

<p>When betting on Correct Scores based on our Program's output, it will <span class='blue'>improve your chances of winning the same amount of money by a factor of AT LEAST 5</span> compared to the same amount spent on a Lottery. And that must be a benefit well worth having!</p>

<p>To improve your chances of pulling in that big Correct Scores win quicker, <span class='blue'>we concentrate on just 6 carefully selected matches </span>. And, in conjunction with our sister website <a class='sales' href='http://www.soccer-americas.com'>www.soccer-americas.com</a>, we do that each and every weekend, 52 weeks a year! </p>

<p>We then recommend a primary "win" line and three alternative "hedge betting" lines for the Correct Scores in an effort to increase your chances of pulling up a line of 6 correct predictions. We call this our <B>Express Advisory Service</B> ("<B>EASE 6</B>" for short), which has proved to be a great success with our Clients.</p>

<p><b>We present our weekly "EASE 6" predictions in a very easy-to-understand format</b> and we then follow it up the following week with a full report of how those predictions actually performed. Take a look <a class='sales' href="javascript:sele_win('ease-details.php?PARA=2009-2010,4')">here</a> to see how we do this (you will in fact be looking at an updated "EASE 6" summary page).</p>

<p><em>Our Program tracks the reliability of its predictions</em> in a great variety of ways in order to identify those matches where <b>the expectation of the</b> <span class='blue'>anticipated score-lines</span> <b>from the two teams combined is the highest it can be!</B> </p>

<p>You could never achieve the same thing manually or by listening to your heart! So without data from a sophisticated prediction Program such as ours, <span class='redi'>your own score-line predictions would be like shooting blindfolded at a distant target!</span></p>

<H2>OUR CHARGES</H2>

<p>As I said before, <span class='blue'>you can obtain our services for less than £1 a week</span>, and the breadth and depth of the data we provide you with is worth an enormous amount more than that.   </p>

<p>For those who are interested in such things, we also present lots of backup charts and graphs for the match calls we post. Plus we have links to great news portals. This ensures that <B>all the soccer betting data you will ever need is right here in one place, on our website!</b></p>

<H2>FULFILLING YOUR DREAM OF RICHES </H2>

<p>I hope that by now I have helped you understand why <B>Correct Scores betting</B> is the only way you stand any real chance of making a killing at soccer betting without the fear of bankrupting yourself! However, you may still not feel comfortable enough with us to rely upon our predictions of the possible score-lines. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, if you want to get rich at Correct Scores betting <span class='bluei'>using your own score-lines</span>, <B>you will still need to have a valid and systematic way of accurately determining what those score-lines should be. </B> </p>

<p>Without a good selections system you would simply be "shooting in the dark", and <B>yyou therefore need access to excellent background data to help you make the right choices.</B></p>

<p>So, if you would prefer to make your own alternative score-line predictions, you will find that we supply you with all the background data you need for that purpose, not just for the "EASE 6" predictions but also for all our other posted predictions! In fact, <b>there is no other website out there that gives you anywhere close to the level of data we provide</b> <span class='bluei'>at such an affordable price!</span></p>

<p>To see what extra background info you get for each match for less than £1 a week, simply take a look at this typical "<a class='sales' href='team-performance-chart-last.php'>Performance Indicator Chart</a>" and its associated backup information for a match in the UK Premier Division. You will see it even shows the 1X2 Odds for all the matches, plus the Odds for the 13 most common Correct Score lines together with the Double Chance, Win Only (Draw = No Bet), Under/Over and Asian Handicap Odds.</p>

<p>We also give you lots of other useful data too, including <B>score-line likelihood ratings</B>, likely "<B>goals advantage</B>" <b>data</b> and other information that will help you considerably with your Correct Scores betting (as well as with Asian Handicap, Half-Time/Full-Time and Under/Over betting if you also enjoy those particular bet types).</p>

<p><b>We primarily produce this additional data for the very serious Bettors</b> who love to do their own thorough research. You don't ever have to go there or bother with it if you don't wish to, but it's always on tap if you do! And, inevitably, if you do take the trouble to understand it all, you will <span class='blue'>learn how to better your chances of making money from soccer betting!</span></p>

<p>You owe it to yourself to make your hard-earned money do more for you than keep the Bookies fat, so <B>set your eyes on the far greater prizes offered by Correct Scores betting</B>, without it costing you any more than your current 1X2 betting does. </p>

<p><b>We are here to assist you all the way to fulfilling your dreams of getting a jackpot soccer win</b> by making it easy for you to make good selections if you don't have the time to do all the research for yourself.</p>

<p>So <span class='blue'>help us to help you</span> by joining us right now to get the first <B>2 months' access to our services at half price!</B></p>

<H2>COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS </H2>

<p>Another way to think about what our services can do for you is that <span class='blue'>fulfilling your dream of making it big must be worth more than £1 a week to you</span>, and without our data you won't stand very much chance on your own. This is because the Bookies are far too clever to lose regularly to Bettors who don't operate both <B>a valid Prediction System and an effective Selection System</B>. But <span class='bluei'>we do</span> operate such Systems, which you can get access to for such a very small outlay.  </p>

<p>Remember, betting is a very serious business, not a game. So if you want to be successful you need to have the right data at your finger tips. <span class='blue'>And we provide first-class soccer predictions backup data at a price you can easily afford!</span></p>

<p>Even if you are only interested in finding out what the best 1X2 Odds are being offered for all the matches in Europe's main Divisions, <B>and where the lowest Over-Rounds are</B>, you can get all that from us as part of our normal service.</p>

<p>In fact, if you yourself were to try to replicate everything we post on our website, it would take you far more time than you could ever possibly spare, just to end up with a grossly inferior product to what we offer! So why bother? Because <span class='bluei'>for less than £1 a week</span> you can have superb data from us, and we will deliver it each and every week without fail. </p>

<p>If you are a truly serious Bettor who demands first-class analytical information, then <B>having access to the data we provide is</B> <span class='blue'>almost like having your own computer program!</span></p>

<p>Added to this, <B>we let you try our Service out</B> for <span class='blue'>2 full months at half price</span>, with a <span class='blue'>100% guarantee of getting your money back</span> if you are not satisfied by the end of the first month.</p>

<H2>LOST OPPORTUNITIES</H2>

<p>If you are still hesitating about joining us, ask yourself these two simple questions:</p>

<ul style='margin-left:20px;'>
	<li>If you don't have the time or skills to collate and analyse everything to the extent we do, how could you possibly hope to improve your chances of getting a <span class='bluei'>Jackpot Soccer Win</span> under your own steam to anywhere near the level of opportunity we achieve? </li>

	<li>How would you feel if you didn't subscribe to our services and then learnt you had missed out on another <span class='bluei'>Jackpot Soccer Win</span> our regular subscribers had been in on?  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you answered those two questions honestly, then you will have proved to yourself why <B>you need access to our services, starting today!</B></p>

<p>However, if you're still uncertain about what our services can do for you, why not consider trying us out for the first 4 weeks entirely at our risk? </p>

<p>You will then be able to establish first-hand how our Correct Scores picks do compared to your own picks, <span class='boldi'>and how well our proximity to a 'Big Win' compares to your success rate on the Lottery! </span></p>

<p>I'm absolutely certain that making those comparisons will remove all your doubts about our usefulness to you! </p>

<p><span class='bluei'>But first, of course, you would need to join us.</span></p>

<H2>SO YOU TAKE YOUR BETTING SERIOUSLY?</H2>

<p>If you still haven't hit the "Join Now" button at this point, then it can only be because <B>you must be very serious about your betting</B> and haven't seen enough so far to convince yourself that we take match analysis anywhere near as seriously as you do.</p>

<p>So let me ask you to take a look at the section entitled <a class='sales' href='ba/using-the-blank-ease-spreadsheets.php'>Blank "EASE" Spreadsheet Explained</a>. It is actually contained under the main menu heading of 'Services Information', and so it is not immediately visible to the casual visitor. In that location it doesn't alarm those who never realised just how complex the subjects of soccer predictions and soccer betting really are! </p>

<p>Anyway, once you have read that section right through, I am confident that any lingering doubts you may have held about the seriousness with which we take the subject of <span class='blue'>your soccer betting success</span> will be completely dispelled. </p>

<p>In fact, I am sure that <b>what you read will whet your appetite</b> to the point where you would love to test out just how our "EASE" Correct Scores soccer betting system works, and whether or not it is as effective as the methods you employ. </p>

<p>And you have nothing to lose and everything to gaina there, because <b>your first 4 weeks access to everything on our website is totally at OUR risk</b>. </p>

<p><span class='blue'>So please join us today! </span>I look forward to having you on board with us,</p>
