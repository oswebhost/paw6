<p>Last week we gave you 2 matches that we felt had good potential for “doubles” Correct Scores “hedge betting”, and we were right.  If you had placed a bet on all 9 possible permutations of the score-lines 1-0 through to 3-0 for both matches, then the 1-0 and 3-0 score-lines that came through would have given you a profit of 755% on your outlay (£77 return for 9 x £1 bets).</p>   
    
<p>This week we have another 2 matches for you consider as Home Win bets, although we are not so confident about the ability of the Away teams not scoring, and they might even be capable of forcing a Draw!  Those 2 matches are: (1) Tottenham v Cardiff (on Sunday at 16:30 UK time) and (2) Paris SG v Marseille (Sunday at 20:00 UK time).</p>

<p>Our preferred score-lines in priority order are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Tottenham v Cardiff (2-0, 1-0 and 3-0 at Odds of 6.50, 7.50 and 8.50 respectively).</li>
    <li>Paris SG v Marseille (2-0, 1-0 and 2-1 at Odds of 6.00, 6.50 and 8.50 respectively).</li>
</ol>

<p>The Odds for the Double Chance are: Match (1) 1.07 and Match (2) 1.08, making 1.156 as the combined Odds for the double.  This means that if you are laying out £9 for your 9 Correct Scores doubles bets, then you need to lay out £8 on the double for the Double Chance outcome in order to cover the potential losses on the Correct Scores hedge betting. </p>

<p>How much would you win if both matches resulted in score-lines of 2-0?  The answer is £31 profit (= a return of 183%).  Of course, the Double Chance hedge betting reduces the Return on Investment, but we feel it is a safer way to go.    </p>

<p>Of course, if just one of those 2 matches results in an Away win, then you would lose a total of £17.  So think very carefully before deciding to bet if you can’t afford to lose!</p>
