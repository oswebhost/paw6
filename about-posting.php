<p><b>Our base predictions data is posted on a weekly basis for matches to be played from Monday through to the following Sunday (although some Odds data may be missing in the early part of the week if the Bookies have not yet made it available). </b> </p>

<p>Most Midweek data is available from Monday lunchtime (UK time), and the Weekend data is generally posted at the latest by Friday evening UK time (and much earlier wherever possible).</p>

<p>All references to time in this section and elsewhere on this website refer to UK time (which is not the same as GMT in the summer months) and, generally, when we refer to a "week" on our website, we mean a period running from the matches played in UK time from Monday through to and including the following Sunday's matches (although that might not be 100% correct for Sunday night matches played in the Americas, since there is sometimes a time overlap).</p>

<p>At some point in the week - and definitely before a match is played - our predictions/selections postings will eventually require_once full details of the Odds being offered by the Bookies, comprising the standard "1X2" Odds and, where available, "Correct Scores", "Double Chance", "Win Only" (Draw = No Bet), "Under/Over" and "Asian Handicap" Odds. </p>

<p>However, we cannot guarantee precisely when the Odds will be posted, specifically because we are reliant on the Bookies to post those Odds first (and the timing for that can vary from one week to the next).  So please read the following carefully in order that you will not be disappointed by looking for the Odds too soon!</p>

<p><span class='bb'>Monday (Midweek) Postings</span></p>

<p>We post the Midweek matches on Mondays, and we show the Odds on offer from the Bookies  wherever they are available that day.  Where the Odds are not available on Monday (which often happens for some of the week's later matches), we will post the Odds later in the week (either on the same day as they become available or otherwise in advance of the relevant matches being played).</p>

<p>The postings are listed Country-by-Country (in alphabetical order), Division-by-Division (in ranked Division order), date order and, lastly, match-by-match (in alphabetical order of the Home Team).  </p>

<p>On Monday we also post what we call our <b>"Blank" EASE Spreadsheets</b> (both for Europe & the Americas where the seasons overlap), with the Odds for the Midweek matches on board wherever available, and we update the spreadsheets almost daily during most weeks as and when outstanding Odds data arrives.  </p>

<p><em>[<b>"Using the "Blank" EASE Spreadsheet"</b> is explained in a separate section located under <span class='bb'>Services Information</span>. It is very closely allied to the <b>"EASE 6" Spreadsheet</b>, which is explained <b>in outline only</b> below and in full detail under the Services Information's section titled <b>"EASE 6" Detailed Explanation</b>.]</em></p>

<p><span class='bb'>Friday (Weekend) Postings</span></p>

<p>On Fridays, under the menu heading <b>"EASE 6" Spreadsheets</b>, we post <b>the fully completed "EASE 6"</b> (see below for outline explanation) for the 6 matches especially selected by the Predict-A-Win Management Team for Correct Scores hedge betting purposes for the upcoming weekend's matches (those taking place on Saturday and Sunday).  Please note that our "EASE 6" postings are primarily geared towards <b>CORRECT SCORES</b> hedge betting, AND <b>NOT 1X2</b> betting! </p>

<p>We also post the data for the <b>"Prime Home Win Calls (Top 6)"</b> section for the current week's weekend matches, which contains the Top 6 "Home Win" possibilities identified by the PaW Program, categorised into Short, Medium and Long Odds.</p>

<p>For the use of our experienced members, we also post the updated <b>BLANK "EASE" Spreadsheets</b> for the weekend for both Europe and the Americas (which will have all the available Odds on board for all the weekend's matches).</p>

<p><em><b>"EASE 6" Outline Explanation:</b></em></p>

<div style='padding-left:50px;'>
<p>Our <b>Correct Scores</b> Selections are posted in the form of a spreadsheet that we call the <b>"EASE 6"</b> (where "EASE" is short for <b>"Express Advisory Service"</b>). The <b>"EASE 6"</b> spreadsheet is primarily aimed at those who don't have time to spend doing lots of research for themselves and who just want a shortcut way to making 6 Correct Scores calls that each stand a reasonably good chance of being successful. However, it must be borne in mind that expecting to get 6 Correct Scores right in 1 week would not be realistic, as <span class='red'>the chances are only 1 in 200,000  at the very best!</span></p>

<p>However, other than for the once in every 1300 life-times "Big Win" on a National Lottery, betting on 6 carefully considered Correct Scores selections will generally give you <span class='bb'>at least 5 times more chances of success</span> of achieving the same amount of winnings as you would get from using the same outlay on most National Lotteries. </p>

<p>All betting is a risk, with no guarantee of success. But what we aim to do with our "<b>EASE 6</b>" Correct Scores selections is to put ourselves in a position where we stand a much better chance of finding that multiple-line combination which, for just a very small outlay, will <b>give us the opportunity to make a killing!</b>  However, if you would like to put this idea into action for yourself, then you must understand that (i) you should check and see for yourself that the "EASE 6" score-lines we post rarely give us more than 2 hits on average per week, and (ii) you must do a fair bit of legwork to establish what you truly consider will be the most likely actual score-lines!  <b>Don't expect to get rich if you still insist on taking a lazy approach to your Correct Scores betting!</b>  </p>

<p>We initially present our "<b>EASE 6</b>" selections in a posted <b>Summary</b> format, showing 4 sets of alternative "hedge betting" score-lines for each of the matches, and which are all taken from a very sophisticated backup spreadsheet.</p>
