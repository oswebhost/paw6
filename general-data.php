<p>Under this section we post data that is not specific to the predictions for the current week and which can therefore be accessed by anyone at all, including casual visitors.  It comprises the complete <strong>"Fixtures List"</strong> for the current week, plus <strong>"League Tables"</strong> and <b>"Results Matrices"</b> for all the Divisions we cover.</p>

<p>Under the heading of <strong>"Prediction Performance Records"</strong> we post both the "prediction" and "outcome" records for the predictions we have posted over the course of many previous seasons, so that you will be able to <strong>verify for yourself exactly where our PaW Program gets it right</strong> and also where it gets it wrong!  If you use this goldmine of data properly in conjunction with our <strong>Soccer Predictions Analysis Tool</strong> ("<span class='bb'>SoccerPAT</span>"), then you should easily be able to figure out precisely what is good to bet on and what it is best to avoid!</p>


<p>Under this section we also provide a lot of theoretical betting advice, which we divide into sections for the novice, the advanced Bettor and the academically inclined (this latter section not being for the weak-hearted, since it can addle the brain a bit).</p>
