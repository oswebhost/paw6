<p>Firstly, before talking in detail about the circumstances under which a refund will be granted to you, we need to tell you the background behind our Refund Policy:</p>

<ol style='margin:0;margin-top:10px;'>
<li style="padding-bottom:5px">We are not selling you betting/gambling tips or advice; we are selling you a data and information based service only. What you do with the data/information we post on this website is your concern, not ours. You shall be deemed to be fully aware of that fact and to have checked prior to making use of our Services that you are comfortable that we only provide data/information and have satisfied yourself that the level and quality of such data/information we provide completely suits your needs.  Refund requests based on the fact that our Program's predictions did not result in the outcome predicted shall be deemed to be inadequate grounds for claiming a refund.  </li>
 
<li style="padding-bottom:5px">Further to the above nobody ever has to subscribe until they are 100% confident that what we are going to supply them with is a first-class information Service.  In order to give newcomers to our website the required level of confidence in the usefulness of our Services, each week we post a number of "Freebie" predictions on our main Home page (the one that everybody lands on when they type the url "www.soccer-predictions.com").</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">Our "Freebie" predictions are what our Predict-A-Win computer Program has selected, from within the particular Divisions that we decide to post Freebie predictions for, as the team(s) having the highest probability of securing a Home Win. They almost certainly do not represent our Predict-A-Win Program's top picks.  </li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">We provide exactly the same data and information for those Home page Freebie predictions as we do for the hundreds of other soccer predictions we put out each week when the European Season is under way.  </li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">If we were silly enough to show our Program's top picks for free, then what would we have to sell?  The answer to that question is: "Nothing"!</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">What we expect all non-subscribing newcomers to do is check out the quality of the data for those Freebie predictions for a few weeks before they decide to subscribe, so that they can satisfy themselves as to how those predictions fare, even though they are not our Program's top picks.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The results of the matches for the weekly Freebie predictions can be accessed by clicking on the "Freestory" tab in the topmost menu bar.  From there, you can easily check to see that the prediction is 100% the same as it was for the week we posted it; there is no shenanigans played by us!   

</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">Since our Program would probably not select all those Freebie predictions as its top picks, what we now do each week is to pick on what we see as the best match in the Freebies list for money making with minimum risk, and we do a "write-up" about it in our "Over The Line" blog (it sits on the main Home page).  This is so that you can see how we use the backup data out Program produces to make a properly considered betting selection.  Sometimes the result for that match doesn't pan out as we judged it would do, but the reasoning we use to make the selection will be absolutely sound, as you will be able to see.  And all our recent "Over The Line" blogs (at least 10 of them) can be viewed by clicking on the links in the right-hand column, whether or not the outcome was good.

</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">So, based on what you have read above, we trust that you can see why we feel that, by the time somebody decides to subscribe, they ought to be able to do so feeling confident that they have made a sound choice, and thus calling for a refund is probably not an act of good faith on their part.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">When somebody subscribes, all the details relevant to the subscription need to be recorded, tracked and monitored, which requires administrative input.  Also, based on the level of the subscriptions revenue at any given time, we lock into long-term advertising campaigns.  If too many people pulled out early, then it would make our life much more difficult, when all we want to do is give our best and put all our effort into providing our quality website information Services.  Thus we feel justified in charging for a small administration "penalty" if people decide to pull out early.  </li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">By the way, we used to give newcomers free Services for 2 weeks, after which they were required to subscribe. You may not believe this but, eventually, by comparing the number of users each week to the number of "newbie" registrations, and by carefully checking email addresses and ISP addresses with the help of some analytical software, we were able to establish that we had at least 1,500 regular users who re-registered with us every 2 weeks in order to get continuous free Services!  Over the 2+ years this went on for, we lost out on about &pound;150,000 worth of revenue! The fact that we were on page 1 of Google for the whole of that period for the search phrase "soccer predictions" was of little compensation to us!</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">But having said all that, we do nonetheless offer refunds to comply with statutory and legal provisions, as indicated below.     </li>


</ol>

<p><b>Refunds for Newly Subscribed Members:</b></p>


<p>In compliance with the UK's "Office of Fair Trading Distance Selling Regulations", if at any time within 7 days of paying your first subscription you decide that you wish to cancel your subscription, then we undertake to refund you in full following your request to us to do so.  Of course, you will then be blacklisted by us and not allowed to subscribe ever again - sorry.  </p>

<p>Your request to cancel your subscription must be emailed to admin@soccer-predictions.com, and must clearly notify us of:</p>

<ol style='margin:0;margin-top:10px;'>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">your decision to cancel your subscription (sent from the email address you registered with us for signup purposes), </li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">your subscription payment details (such as payment date, reference number, etc.), and</li>


<li style="padding-bottom:5px">your User Name. </li>
</ol>

<p>However, if you cancel after that 7-day period has expired, then you will be considered to fall under the refund provisions set out below under the heading "Refunds for Regular Subscribing Members" (i.e. all those Subscribing Members who have not cancelled within the first 7 days of paying their subscriptions).   </p>

<p>We undertake to refund you the amount calculated as described above within 14 days maximum.</p>



<p><b>Refunds for Regular Subscribing Members:</b></p>

<p>Should we fail to provide Services to you through this website for any given week (from Monday of that week until the following Sunday of that same week) where suitable matches for selection were being played (whether such failure was due to server failure or any other reason whatsoever), then for each such full week of unprovided Services we will automatically add on an extra week of Services to your account (and which you can check by reference to your "My Account" details).</p>

<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time after the first month, subject always to the following provisos for the purpose of calculating the refund due to you: (i) your "period of usage" of our Services shall be rounded up to the nearest whole month, (ii) a penalty of an additional month's charges shall be due from you to cover our administration costs (but you will still be able to get full access to our Services for the full length of that extended period for which you have been charged), and (iii) the monthly rate to be applied to the rounded up "period of usage" shall be that which corresponds to the full standard rate for that same period shown in the current Subscription screen on this website, whether or not you took advantage of a promotional or standard discount at the time of subscribing. </p>


<p>Your request to cancel your subscription must be emailed to admin@soccer-predictions.com, and must clearly notify us of:</p>

<ol style='margin:0;margin-top:10px;'>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">your decision to cancel your subscription (sent from the email address you registered with us for signup purposes), 	</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">your subscription payment details (such as payment date, reference number, etc.), and</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">your User Name. </li>


</ol>

<p>We undertake to refund you the amount calculated as described above within 14 days maximum.</p>

<p><b>Example of Refund Calculation for Regular Subscribing Members:</b></p>

<p>The following is shown in order that there will be no misunderstanding as to how the amount to be refunded will be calculated:</p>


<ol style='margin:0;margin-top:10px;'>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The Service paid for was one for 12 months, for which the full standard rate is &pound;345.00, but where advantage was taken of an early bird discount, so only &pound;115.00 was paid.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The subscription was paid on 1<Sup>st</Sup> November, and cancellation was made on 7<Sup>th</Sup> December that same year (meaning that a little over 1 month had elapsed before the cancellation request was made.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The period to be charged would be 3 months, because rounding up the months for which Services were provided would give a figure of 2 months, and the 1-month penalty would make it a total of 3 months to be charged.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The full standard rate for up to 3 months of Services is &pound;125.00 and thus, since the discounted amount paid was only &pound;115.00, there will be no refund at all; the difference in the two figures would not be charged to the departing Member.    </li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">Services would still be available until 31 January in the following year, despite the cancellation having been requested on 7th December in the previous year. </li>

</ol>

<p>The following is another example:</p>

<ol style='margin:0;margin-top:10px;'>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The Service paid for was one for 9 months, for which the full standard rate of &pound;285.00 was paid.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The subscription was paid on 1<Sup>st</Sup> November, and cancellation was made on 7<Sup>th</Sup> January (meaning that a little over 2 months had elapsed before the cancellation request was made.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The period to be charged would be 4 months, because rounding up the months for which Services were provided would give a figure of 3 months, and the 1-month penalty would make it a total of 4 months to be charged.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">The full standard rate for up to 6 months of Services is &pound;215.00, so the amount of the charges for 4 months would be calculated as follows: &pound;215.00 / 6 x 4 = &pound;143.33.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">Since the amount paid was &pound;285.00, the amount to be refunded = &pound;141.67.</li>

<li style="padding-bottom:5px">Services would still be available until 28<Sup>th</Sup> February in the same year as the cancelation requested on 7<Sup>th</Sup> January.     </li>
</ol>

<p>We trust that the above examples explains everything in full about the calculation of the refund due but, if there is any doubt at all, then potential subscribing Members are hereby encouraged to submit their specific queries to admin@soccer-predictions.com prior to paying any subscription. </p>

<p><b>Refund Position After Termination of Your Membership.</b></p>

<p>For the rules applicable to the situation where we have decided to cancel your Membership, please refer to the appropriate paragraph under the Legal/Disclaimer section of this website.</p>
