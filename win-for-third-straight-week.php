<p>Much as we have done for the past two weekends, we have once again identified 2 matches this weekend that we feel have good potential for “doubles” Correct Scores “hedge betting” from amongst the 11 “freebie” matches we show as “teasers” on our Home Page.  </p>   
    
<p>Remember, even though those 11 freebie predictions are not necessarily amongst our Top 10 prime calls, the profit from our Week 30 betting was 755%, and from last weekend’s betting (Week 31) it was 400%!  </p>

<p>Can we do it again?  Well, all gambling is a risk, so you won’t know until the results are in for us, will you?  But once again we will do some 1X2 hedge betting (more on that below) in an effort to cover our potential losses in respect of the Correct Scores betting.     </p>


<p>Our 2 matches for Correct Scores “doubles” betting this week are as follows: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ajax v Cambuur - Holland (on Sunday at 15:30 UK time), and </li>
    <li>FC Porto v Arouca  - Portugal (on Sunday at 19:15 UK time).  </li>
</ol>

<p>Our preferred score-lines in priority order are: </p>

<ol>
    <li>Ajax v Cambuur (3-0, 2-0 and 4-0 at Odds of 7.00, 6.50 and 10.00 respectively).</li>
    <li>FC Porto v Arouca (2-0, 1-0 and 2-1 at Odds of 6.00, 5.00 and 6.50 respectively).</li>
</ol>

<p>We have chosen the above calls based on an in-depth analysis of our Program’s output, plus a detailed review of the capabilities of all four teams involved. Please note especially that, up to the 4-1 result, the 8 other possible calls omitted for each match are as follows:  </p>

<ul style="padding-left:40px;">
    <li>match (1) 1-0, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 0-0, 1-1, 2-2 & 3-3, and  </li>
    <li>match (2) 3-0, 4-0, 3-1, 4-1, 0-0, 1-1, 2-2 & 3-3).  </li>
</ul>

<p>Now, that list makes for a ton of possible alternative results that could see the above Correct Score “doubles” bets blown right out of the water. </p>

<p>And that is why, even though we have confidence this week that the 2 Home teams will win, we are never confident that our 3 preferred Score-lines for each match will come good; after all, they are only 3 possibilities out of 11 possible score-lines up to the 4-1 result – and there are many more possibilities beyond that cut-off point!  So that it is why we will also be doing an Outright Home Win “double” for these 2 matches, where the Stake will be £2 for every £1 we put on against each of the 9 permutations of the above 3 sets of preferred score-lines per match.  That way we stand a chance of ending up with no losses in the event that the Correct Score doubles sink. </p>

<p>The Odds for the Outright Home Win call are: Match (1) 1.22 and Match (2) 1.25, making 1.52 as the combined Odds for the Outright Home Win double.  This means that if you are laying out £9 for your 9 Correct Scores doubles bets (at £1 x 9 bets), then you need to lay out £18 in total on the double for the Outright Home Win outcome in order to cover the potential losses on the doubles Correct Scores hedge betting. </p>

<p>How much would you win on the Correct Scores doubles betting if both matches resulted in score-lines of 3-0?  The answer is £33 profit (= a return of 367%).  Of course, the Outright Home Win hedge betting reduces the Return on Investment to just 122%, but we feel it is a safer way to go.    
Of course, if just one of those 2 matches results in an Away win, then you would lose a total of £27.  So think very carefully before deciding on your own betting/staking plan if you can’t afford to lose, because in the beautiful game of football anything is possible, including a giant stumbling badly!  That could mean that one or both Home teams may end up with a Draw as the result, or they could even lose their matches.  So even if you went for Double Chance betting (risking far higher stakes) you could still lose everything.  Our approach is that we only bet what we can afford, and if we lose this week we will try to make it up next week without increasing the stake levels.
</p>

<p>Whatever you decide to do, we wish you the very best of luck for this weekend’s betting.  And please don’t forget to tell your friends about us!
