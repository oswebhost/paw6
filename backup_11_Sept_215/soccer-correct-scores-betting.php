<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>We have to advise you that <span class='redi' style='color:red'>nobody will ever get rich from standard 1X2 soccer betting unless they're either very lucky or very clever!  </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>The reason for this is simple: <em>the mark-up the Bookies employ makes sure that, generally, they will be the winners each season, and not you!</em> This is especially true of accumulator betting, where you might get extra lucky this week, but then you won't probably be so lucky again for another 6 weeks or longer, so all your winnings will gradually be eaten away. </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Having side that, we have found that clever accumulator betting using “short odds” calls can do very well, and it risks far less money than singles betting to offer the same level of returns, but you need to be very selective and also employ a good Staking Plan!   </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>There is an alternative way for you to risk less money each week, with the possibility of making far more than you would with any form of 1X2 soccer betting, and that's by trying <span class="bb">Correct Scores hedge betting</span>.  But it is a very long term strategy – you can't expect an overnight win.</p>  


<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>However, do remember that <span class='redin'>there is no such thing as a short-term strategy for making a killing with 1X2 soccer betting!</span>  If any other soccer prediction/betting website tries to tell you otherwise, all they are pitching is a pipe dream. Because, in the long-term, with 1X2 soccer betting (and that includes Asian Handicap betting) you stand a good chance of losing more than you win most seasons!  </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'><span class='bluei'>Putting it bluntly:</span> <span class='bluein'>Without soccer prediction data equivalent to what we give our Clients, picking soccer winners would be like target-shooting in the dark - if you hit the mark it would be pure luck, and nothing at all to do with skill!</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Now, since you can get full access to all our data for <span class='bluei'>less than £1 a week</span>, <span class='red'>can you really afford not to use our services?</span> </p>
