   <p>On 27 December last year we told you not to bother with "Favourites" betting. But if you just ignored us and had put £10 per single bet on the top 6 Favourites this past weekend, then you would have lost £25.40! Not only that but, using the same betting strategy to date this season, you would have made only £47.70 on £1380 laid out (a miserable 3.45% profit)!  

<br /><br />On the other hand, if you had followed our advice and put all your money on the Top 6 Home Win calls in the Odds range 2.20 to 2.50 this past weekend, you would have made a profit of 16.25%, despite the many unexpected Draws that occurred. And, better still, if you had followed that same betting philosophy for the whole season to date, you would be up 16.17% on singles betting alone (and the accumulators were worth a lot more, of course)! 


<br /><br />Now will you listen to our advice? "Favourites" betting is a waste of time if you want to get a decent return, simply because of the large Over-Round the Bookies employ. We only bet on the more solid of the HIGHER ODDS matches, which our Program identifies for us on a regular basis. After all, it was Week 26 last week, and we are still well up! Wake up!! And tell your friends about us too!!!
