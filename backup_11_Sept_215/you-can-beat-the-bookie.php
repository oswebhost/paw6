<p>Here are some facts that may interest you:</p>   
    
<p>Let’s suppose we consider that a Bookie’s “favourite” for a Home Win result means that the Odds are a maximum of 1.40.  Now, let’s say you had bet a straight £1 per match (singles) up to a maximum of the “Top 6” such Bookie’s favourites, right from the beginning of this season up to now, using just the UK and European Premier Divisions.  Well, you would have <strong>laid out £163</strong> and be in <strong><font color="blue">profit to the grand tune of £1.47</font></strong>.  Sadly, that’s a return on investment of only 0.9%......... </p>


<p>Out of the <strong>163</strong> matches you would have laid out on, <font color="red"><strong>25</strong> <i>of those “favourites” failed to win</i></font>; they either drew or lost. That would have been <strong>a failure rate of <font color="red">15.34%</strong></font>, meaning that <span class="red italic bold">almost 1 in 6 teams had let you down</span>.  And remember, they were supposed to be the favourites to WIN! </p>


<p>Now let’s suppose that you had decided, instead, to bet on the Top 6 matches displayed on our website for those matches where the Home Win Odds were in the <strong>range 1.60-1.90</strong>.  By contrast, you would now be <span class="bb">£14.67 better off</span> on singles betting alone, having laid out <strong>£167</strong> (only £4 more than on the “favourites”).  That is a <span class="bb">return on investment of 8.78%</span> (almost <span class="bb">10 times more</span> than the ROI on so-called “favourites”)!  </p>


<p>Come on, don’t you owe it to yourself to look further into this, to see if you can improve your ROI for yourself?  Of course you do!  So start using our Soccer Predictions Analysis Tool to help make yourself a winner extraordinaire!  <strong>We’ve done all the hard work for you!</strong></p>
