<p>All references to times in this section refer to UK time, and when we refer to a "week" on our websites we mean a period running from the matches played in UK time from Monday through to and including the following Sunday's matches.</p>

<p>At some point in the week - and definitely before a match is played - our predictions/selections postings will eventually include full details of the Odds being offered by the Bookies, comprising the standard "1X2" Odds and "Correct Scores" Odds (for at least the 13 most common score-lines) and, where available, "Double Chance", "Win Only" (Draw = No Bet), "Under/Over" and "Asian Handicap" Odds. </p>

<p>However, we cannot guarantee precisely when the Odds will be posted, specifically because we are reliant on the Bookies to post those Odds first (and the timing for that can vary from one week to the next). So please read the following carefully in order that you will not be disappointed by looking for the Odds too soon!</p>

<p><span class='bn'><b>Monday (Midweek) Postings</b></span></p>

<p>On Mondays, under the heading of "<strong>FREE PREDICTIONS</strong>" (found in the right-hand menu), we post the full list of fixtures and predictions for the week for the 4 principle UK Minor Divisions (complete with Anticipated Score-Lines) as well as the "Major Divisions - 1X2 Only” predictions" (which do <strong>not</strong> contain details of the Anticipated Score-Lines) for the 12 Premier and 7 Middle Divisions. </p>

<p>The postings referred to above are simply listed Country-by-Country (in alphabetical order), Division-by-Division (in ranked Division order), date order and, lastly, match-by-match (in alphabetical order of the Home Team). </p>

<p>For the midweek matches, on Mondays we will indicate the Odds on offer from the <span style="background: yellow;">Bookies</span> wherever these are available that day. Where the Odds are not available that day (which often happens for some of the week's later matches), we will post the Odds later in the week (either on the same day as they become available or otherwise in advance of the relevant matches being played). </p>

<p>Each Monday we also post into the "<strong>DATA for MEMBERS</strong>" section the full list of fixtures and predictions for the week (complete with Anticipated Score-Lines) for all of the 16 Major/Middle European Divisions and 3 Americas Divisions we cover on our website. </p>

<p>On Monday we also post the <strong>BLANK "EASE" Spreadsheets</strong> (for both Europe & the Americas) with the Odds for the midweek matches on board, and we update them from time to time as and when new Odds data arrives.  </p>


<p><i>["<B>Using the Blank</B> "<B>EASE</B>" <B>Spreadsheet</B>" is explained in a separate section located under <span class='bb'>Services Information</span>. It is very closely allied to the "<B>EASE 6</B>" <B>Spreadsheet</B>, which is explained <b>in outline only</b> below and in full detail under the <span class='bb'>Services Information's</span> section entitled "<B>EASE 6</B>" <B>Detailed Explanation</B>.]</i></p>

<p><span class='bn'><b>Friday (Weekend) Postings</b></span></p>

<p>On Fridays, under the menu heading <strong>"EASE 6" Correct Scores</strong>, we post <strong>the fully completed "EASE 6"</strong> (see below for outline explanation) for the 6 matches especially selected by the Predict-A-Win Management Team for Correct Scores hedge betting purposes for the upcoming weekend’s matches (those taking place on Saturday and Sunday).  Please note that our “EASE 6” postings are primarily geared towards <strong>CORRECT SCORES</strong> hedge betting, AND <strong>NOT 1X2</strong> betting! </p>

<p>We also post the data for the "<strong>Segregated Selections</strong>" section for the current week’s weekend matches, which contains the Top 6 “Home Win” possibilities identified by the PaW Program, categorised into Short, Medium and Long Odds.</p>

<p>For the use of our experienced Clients, we also post the updated <strong>BLANK "EASE" Spreadsheets</strong> for the weekend for both Europe and the Americas (which will have all the available Odds on board for all the weekend’s matches).</p>

<p><I>"<B>EASE 6</B>" <B>Outline Explanation:</B></I></p>

<p style='padding-left:70px;'>Our <strong>Correct Scores</strong> Selections are posted in the form of a spreadsheet that we call the "<strong><em>EASE 6</em></strong>" (where "EASE" is short for "<strong><em>Express Advisory Service</em></strong>"). The "<strong>EASE 6</strong>" spreadsheet is primarily aimed at those who don't have time to spend doing lots of research for themselves and who just want a shortcut way to making 6 Correct Scores calls that each stand a reasonably good chance of being successful. However, it must be borne in mind that expecting to get 6 Correct Scores right in 1 week would not be realistic, as <span style="color: red;"><strong>the chances are only 1 in 80,000 at the very best!</strong></span>  </p>

<p style='padding-left:70px;'>However, other than for the once in every 1300 life-times "Big Win" on an International Lottery, our "<B>EASE 6</B>" Correct Scores selections will generally give you <span class='bb'>at least 5 times more chances of success</span> of achieving the same amount of winnings as you would get using the outlay on the Lottery. </p>

<p style='padding-left:70px;'>All betting is a risk, with no guarantee of success. But what we aim to do with our "<B>EASE 6</B>" Correct Scores selections is to put you in a position where you stand a much better chance of finding that multiple-line combination which, for just a very small outlay, will <B>give you the opportunity to make a killing!</B></p>

<p style='padding-left:70px;'>We initially present our "<B>EASE 6</B>" selections in a Summary format, showing 4 sets of alternative "hedge betting" score-lines for each of the matches, and which are all taken from a very sophisticated backup spreadsheet. If you really are into this sort of thing and wish to see the spreadsheet itself, then all you have to do is click on the link shown on that Summary  page. You will then be presented with a spreadsheet that you can download to review at your leisure.</p>
