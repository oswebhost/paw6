<p>From amongst the free picks we post on the Home page of our website, we have identified what we think is a reasonable “Doubles” Correct Score bet for this weekend. Remember that our Home page “freebies” do not represent our Top 10 picks. Each match is what our Program has selected as the best Home Win selection from each of the individual Premier European Divisions playing this week. So all we will be trying to show you here is how we ourselves look at our Program’s prediction for a match compared to the actual past performance data and the Bookies Odds/thinking.</p>   
    
<p>Our first match is Man City v Stoke due to be played on Saturday 22 Feb, where our Program’s predicted score-line is -3-0 and the Bookies have given Stoke an advantage of 2.25 goals but expect that the Man City Asian Handicap bet will lose (Odds are 2.05 v 1.85). That would lead us to suspect that the Bookies consider that 2-0 is the most likely score-line, and the Correct Score Odds for the “favourite” score-line bear that out: 2-0 (7.00) and 3-0 (7.50), while the next lowest Odds on offer are 11.00 for the 1-0 result.</p>

<p>Now, in the last 4 seasons that Stoke played away to Man City, they lost on every occasion, the latest 2 results being 3-0 each, while the earlier 2 matches both produced a 2-0 win for Man City.  When playing at home, Stoke managed to force a Draw against Man City on every occasion for those same 4 seasons.</p>   
    
<p>Stoke’s away performance so far this season has been similar to last season, while Man City has lost only 1 of its 12 matches this season and won all the others, often with spectacular score-lines. So is another 3-0 win for Man City over Stoke the most likely result this weekend? We believe it is, since on average Stoke has let in more than 2 goals per match so far this season when playing away, while Man City has scored over 3 goals per match at home on average. Another interesting fact here is that the Bookies are offering Odds of only 1.40 for OVER 2.5 goals scored and 2.87 for the UNDER 2.5 goals call, which means that, despite the lowest Correct Score Odds being 7.00 for the 2-0 result, the Bookies are expecting more than a total of 2.5 goals to be scored. Strange, isn’t it? And that is why we ourselves will stick with our Program’s 3-0 prediction as our prime chosen score-line, but with 2-0 as the hedge bet.         </p>

<p>The second match is PAOK v Panthrakikos for Sunday 23 Feb, where our Program has calculated that PAOK will win with a 3-0 score-line. The Bookies have given Panthrakikos a 1.50 goal advantage and yet still expect PAOK to win, because the Asian Handicap Odds are 1.83 v 2.03. The Bookies Odds for the most favoured score-lines are: 2-0 (5.50), 1-0 (6.50) and 3-0 (7.00).  It seems that the Bookies don’t have much faith in Panthrakikos scoring anything at all against PAOK. So are they right? </p>   
    
<p>Well, in the three times since 2008 when Panthrakikos played away to PAOK at home, Panthrakikos never scored anything at all, and PAOK won all 3 matches (from most recent backwards: 1-0, 2-0 and 3-0).  Even when Panthrakikos was playing at its home venue (4 times including this season) they lost to PAOK on every occasion and only scored 1 goal on two occasions.  So, yes, the Bookies seem to have it right – Panthrakikos’s chances of scoring even 1 goal against PAOK seem very slim based on past performance. </p>

<p>On the other hand, out of 11 Away matches this season Panthrakikos scored 1 goal in 5 of them and 2 goals in 3 other matches, and only 3 times did they not score at all. By contrast, PAOK have won 11 of their home matches this season and drawn once when playing a newly promoted team. In addition, out of those 12 home matches PAOK failed to score only in the drawn game, and in the remaining 11 matches scored a lowly 1 only twice. In 6 of those 12 matches PAOK’s goal count alone took the count to over 2.5 goals. That’s why the Bookies are offering Odds of only 1.72 for the Over 2.5 goals call and 2.07 for the under call.</p>   
    
<p>The average goal count per match for PAOK at home so far this season is 2.50 goals, and for Panthrakikos playing away it is 1.00 goal. It also has to be borne in mind that Panthrakikos is not a weak team, and currently it sits just under one-third down from the top of the table. Clearly the Bookies believe that 3-0 is a distinct possibility, since the Odds stand at 7.00 only, whereas 4-0 and 3-1 Odds are both set at 12.00.</p>
<p>Although the Bookies consider that 2-0 is the most likely score-line we will still opt to stay with our Program’s 3-0 call, although we will place a hedge bet on the 2-0 score-line too, in an attempt to recover as much as possible of our stake money if the 3-0 is not successful.</p>   
    
<p>Anyway, check out the details for yourself from the Home page of our website, and see if you think we’ve got it wrong for these 2 matches.  And if you do, we’d be pleased to hear from you. All constructive comments are welcome.</p>
