 <strong><em>Site Membership:</em></strong><br /><br />
 
 We have produced a unique piece of software for the specific purpose of making <strong>worthwhile soccer predictions</strong> (called the <strong>“Predict-A-Win” Program – “PaW” Program for short</strong>). We use that PaW Program to produce a vast array of essential soccer data that we then post on this website, and which will help you to <strong>make better soccer betting selections</strong>, whether you are an expert or a novice.</p>

<p>We offer two different classes of Membership for this website:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none;padding:0;margin:0px;margin-left:60px;padding-top:10px;">
    <li class='dotted_li'><span class="credit">Subscribing Members</span> (paying), and</li>
    
    <li class="dotted_li"><span class="credit">Registered Members</span> (non-paying).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Subscribing Members</strong> pay just <span class="bb">£4 per month</span> to get unrestricted access to absolutely everything on this website.</p>

<p><strong>Registered Members</strong> can get access to a limited but useful range of data, comprising 1X2 predictions for the Major Divisions we handle (but no Anticipated Score-Lines or backup data given), plus the full details of all our PaW Program’s “Away Win” calls (but which are nowhere near as successful as our “Home Win” calls that are available only to <strong>Subscribing Members</strong>). </p>

<p>Yes, the intention is to turn Registered Members into Subscribing Members by showing them what they are missing out on, and they can get access to all our soccer predictions data for <span class="bb">less than £1 a week!</span></p>

<p><strong><em>Site Services:</em></strong><br /><br />
Although we post 1X2 predictions, <strong>we concentrate on Correct Scores betting</strong>, primarily because we believe it offers <strong>far better money-making opportunities</strong> than standard 1X2 betting ever could. </p>

<p><B>With 1X2 betting, the average Bettor loses about 50% of his/her Base Bank each season</B> (and some even 100%, sometimes long before the season is over). Although <B>our predictions data will cure that problem for the thinking novice</B>, we know that 1X2 betting will never make them rich (or anyone else, except the Bookies)!
</p>
		
<p>So we advocate putting some of the 1X2 betting funds into C<strong>orrect Scores betting</strong>, and <strong>we make it easy</strong> for the novice to see what we ourselves will be betting on for the Correct Scores scenario each week.  </p>

<p>We also provide soccer <B>prediction data that caters for the truly experienced Bettors</B> who may enjoy 1X2 betting most, and who are content trying to increase their Base Bank by just 10% or so each season, knowing that they are on reasonably safe ground. </p>

<p>We not only provide predictions but also <B>a wealth of relevant associated backup stats too</B> for the following Premier Divisions:</p>


<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;padding:0;margin:0px;margin-left:60px;padding-top:10px;font-weight: bold;">
	<li><div style="background: yellow;float: left;">for European:</div><br/>
	<div class='bb' style='padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:20px;'><B><I>England, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Scotland, Spain and Turkey</I></B></div></li><br />

	<li><div style="background: yellow;float: left;">for the American:</div> <br />
	<div class='bb' style='padding-left:20px;'><I><B>Brazil (Serie A and B) and the USA (MLS)  </B></I></div></li>

</ol>

<p style='padding-top:10px'>Plus we cover the 10 English/Scottish Middle/Minor Divisions.</p>

<p><i>Please note that, because (i) the timing of the seasons are so very different, and (ii) we prefer to analyse and compare data on a seasonal basis, we keep the postings for the European and Americas Divisions completely separate. So, when we talk of posting something on a given day of the week, then we are generally referring to the two different sets of data required for the two distinct locations, Europe and the Americas (the latter so-termed because we cover Divisions from both North & South America).</i></p>


<p><B>Our data is posted on a weekly basis for all those matches playing from Monday through to the following Sunday.</B> Most Midweek data is available from Monday lunchtime (UK time), and the Weekend data is generally posted by Friday evening UK time at the latest.</p>

<p>Our website has been designed as much as possible for intuitive navigation and easy understanding of the information being viewed, but we are always open to suggestions as to how to improve the interface to provide a more satisfying user experience.</p>

<p>So that you are fully aware of the chances or otherwise of your soccer bets under-performing, we strongly advise you to make the effort to do your own research if possible. To assist you in understanding our Program’s predictions we give you <strong>a phenomenal range of analytical tools</strong> (such as our very useful <a class="prv" href="../team-performance-chart-last.php?id=6518">Team Performance Records</a>  and all the backup data associated with it), which enables you (i) to check out our tips "on the day" and (ii) to decide for yourself whether you wish to stick with your own selections or accept our Program’s predictions.  </p>

<p>If nothing else, our soccer prediction data should enable you to very easily validate your own assessment of the likelihood of the match outcomes. But the quality of our backup data is such that <strong>your prediction ability cannot fail to be improved if you make the most of what we post!</strong></p>

<p>Of course, we can't give any guarantees or warranties of any sort as to the reliability or otherwise of our predictions, even though certain postings may represent our "Prime” selections. This is because betting is a very uncertain business and therefore highly risky; the "Goliaths" get toppled by the "Davids" far too often for our liking.</p>

<p>You are therefore deemed to be solely responsible for any betting losses you may incur. Specifically, you are strongly advised not to rely solely upon information and data found on this website but to <strong>do your own legwork</strong> to research and test the validity or otherwise of our predictions. In this regard, you shall be deemed to have read and accepted our <a class='prv' href='../disclaimer.php'>Disclaimer</a>. </p>

<p>We also caution you that you should always bet wisely <strong><em>(meaning, never with more money than you can afford to lose)</em></strong>. If you have any problems in this regard and would like some help to control your betting habit, please visit the following link for assistance: </p>
