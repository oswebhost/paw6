<p>The Odds we quote on our website are faithfully compiled from the Odds posted on the Internet by well-known and respected Bookies, and are double-checked by us in-house before posting. We record all the Odds from the Bookies in a database as well as separate details of the actual Odds we post on the website, which are then retained as permanent records. In truth, we learnt the hard way that such attention to detail is vital!    </p>  

<p>Please take note that the Bookies may suddenly change certain Odds, especially where the level of betting is unexpectedly high in favour of a particular result. So if you make a Selection late, you may miss out on the best Odds. This has been particularly true in the past of Asian Handicap Odds, although we have seen less of it recently, probably as a result of the very late posting by the Bookies nowadays of the Asian Handicap Odds.  But it most certainly still affects 1X2 and Double Chance Odds!    </p>     

<p>For the 1X2 Calls we use the terms "Short Odds", "Medium Odds" and "Long Shots" on our website, which we define as follows for the current season:</p>
