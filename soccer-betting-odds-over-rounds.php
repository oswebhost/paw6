<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'><span class='boldi'>This is our 8th season online</span>. And just in case you are wondering, the majority of us are Brits, although we wouldn't survive without our superb backup team of programmers and data gatherers who hail from different countries.  <em>[You try collecting all the Odds for yourself and you’ll soon see what I mean!]</em></p>


<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'><span class='bb'>We provide a 52-weeks-a-year soccer prediction service</span> by covering both European and American Soccer Divisions, so you never have to miss out on your weekly soccer betting fun, because we're here for you all year round!</p>


<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>We don't offer you useless bonuses to subscribe to us. We just provide an honest-to-goodness soccer prediction service that gives you <span class='bb'>superb value for money, week after week.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>For example, in addition to listing all the fixtures for each current week for <span class='red'>20 top Divisions across Europe and America</span>, our weekly soccer prediction data not only gives you the Odds for 1X2 betting but also the <span class='bluei'>Odds for Double Chance, Correct Scores, Asian Handicap, Under/Over and Half-Time/Full-Time betting.</span> </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>And <span class='boldi'>we even calculate the Over-Rounds</span> for you on the 1X2 Odds and give you a ranked report so you can see which soccer matches offer the most attractive Odds.</p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Plus, every weekend, we also post a "<a class='sales' href="javascript:sele_win('ease-details.php?PARA=2010-2011,7,eu')"><span class='blue' style='color:green'><u>pre-filled</u></span></a>" weekend version of our EASE "Blank" spreadsheet, where we select 6 matches which we think have the best chances of meeting our expectations in respect of Correct Scores hedge betting (and which, for obvious reasons, we call the "<strong><font color="purple">EASE 6</font></strong>" <strong><font color="purple">Spreadsheet</font></strong>).   </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Of course, the same thing goes for the completed "EASE 6" spreadsheet as for the "Blank" EASE - we tell you how to use it but, if you are in any doubt at all about how it works, then I personally undertake responsibility for answering any questions you may have about how to use it -  just email me at  <span class="bluen"><em>woz@soccer-predictions.com</em></span>.</p>

 <p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'><span class="bb"><em>Now, you can't get a much more personal service than that, can you?</em></span> </p>


<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0;font-size:16px;color:#b80000;'><b><i>And all for less than £1 a week!</i></b></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>But it gets better still if you are a first-time subscriber and elect to pay us on a monthly recurring payment basis through our authorised Merchant Account Provider, <strong><font color="purple">Netbanx</font></strong>:  because, as a new subscriber, you will get the <span class="bluen">first 2 months soccer predictions at half-price</span>.  Which means that our superb service will cost you <span class="redi">less than £0.50 a week for the first 9 weeks!</span>  </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'><i>There are no hidden charges or extras to pay for, and you get access to our full soccer prediction services and content from day one!</i></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Also, <span class='boldi'>you are free to cancel your monthly subscription at any time</span> without it costing you a penny more!  And if you do so in the first month after initially subscribing, then <span class='redi'>we will refund you in full!</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0;font-size:14px;color:blue;''><b>So you have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain!</b></p>
