<p>For 2 weekends running we have supplied our Clients with Double Correct Score hedge betting opportunities, <span class='bb'>and both weeks we have been 100% successful!</span>  Anyone following what we did would have <span class='bb' style='color:purple'><i>made a lot of money!</i></span>  You can see the previous weekend’s result from the <span class='bb'>Europe Week 30 Observations</span> below. <strong>We intend to highlight similar opportunities each week from now on.</strong></p>   
    
<p>Last weekend we told you about the 2 matches we were betting on and what hedge betting we were doing, which included <i><strong>9 Correct Score “doubles” bets and a solitary Double Chance (1X) bet.</strong></i>  This followed the weekend where our Correct Scores doubles betting made us <span class='bb'>755% profit!</span></p>

<p><i>Look, even if the Correct Scores doubles had not produced a winner last weekend, the winnings from the Double Chance bet exactly matched the total outlay for the weekend, so we would not have lost a penny, leaving our winnings from the previous weekend intact! </i> </p>


<p><span class='bb'>BUT WE GOT IT RIGHT</span>, and one of our hedge betting combinations came through for us, at Odds of 7.50 & 6.00 respectively!  That double gave us a return of <span class='bb'>400% profit!</span>  If you doubt what we say, see our last weekend’s Facebook posting – that doesn’t lie!  And it was on our website too for our 2000 Clients to see. </p>

<p>Coupled with the win from the previous weekend, that gave us <span class='bb'>an overall profit of 1155% profit</span> on our initial capital outlay of £9 (we were simply carrying forward winnings for the second week – no fresh capital input was required). </p>

<p>Now, isn’t the info we give you each week exactly what you and your friends need?  If so, <span class='bb' style='color:purple'>please go tell your friends about us</span> – don’t just keep it to yourself!</p>
