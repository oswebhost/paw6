<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Our aim is to give you <span class='bb'>quality soccer prediction backup data</span> that will allow you to see clearly for yourself exactly what <span class='bb'>the best soccer betting opportunities</span> are, no matter if you prefer going for Outright Winners, Asian Handicap Winners or even Under/Over bets.  </p>

<p style='margin-top:10px;padding-top:0'>Some other soccer prediction websites just offer you a listing of the probabilities for the 3 possible 1X2 match outcomes. <b>We go way beyond that!</b></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>We present our soccer predictions data in many different ways to enable you to easily cross-reference what you are looking at and thus <span class='red'>develop your own rock solid convictions</span> about which matches you are going to bet on!</p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Here are <span class='bb'>3 superb tools</span> we post on this website to <span class='bb'>help you identify great soccer betting selections</span> (there are many other useful charts and tables too):</p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>
	<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
		
		<li style='padding-left:10px;margin-left:30px;'>Our unique "<a href="team-performance-chart.php?id=4137&site=eu"><strong><font color="purple">Performance Indicator Chart</font></strong></a>": a colourful series of <span class='bb'>tables, charts and graphs</span> for each and every match, which let you appreciate <strong><em>visually</em></strong> how the 2 teams in a match have done so far this season as well as last season (because that's highly necessary at the start of a new season).</li>
        
        <li style='padding-left:10px;margin-left:30px;'>A completely interactive "<a href="javascript:bigwin('soccer-selections-analysis-tool.php?db=eu')"><strong><font color="purple">Soccer Selections Analysis Tool</font></strong></a>", which allows you to check out many "what if" scenarios directly on this website</li>
    
     <li style='padding-left:10px;margin-left:30px;'>A weekly downloadable interactive ”<a href="soccer-predictions-backup-data.php"><strong><font color="purple">Blank “EASE” Spreadsheet</font></strong></a>”, on which we place all the relevant data necessary for making good soccer betting decisions, extracted directly from our computer program's soccer prediction output.</li>
	</ul>

</p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>We refer to the downloadable spreadsheets as our "<b>Express Advisory Service</b>" ("<span class='bb' style="color: purple;">EASE</span>" for short), primarily because each spreadsheet brings together a great deal of the soccer prediction background data our software program relies upon as input (such as <span class='redi'>scoring abilities, current ranking</span>, etc.), plus what it produces as the final outputs (such as <span class='redi'>probability and reliability data</span>).</p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Also, a great deal of the information you see on the "Blank" EASE spreadsheet can be seen in pictorial and chart form on each Performance Indicator Chart ("<span class='bb' style="color: purple;">PIC</span>" for short). We simply collate and tabulate that same data on the EASE spreadsheet <span class='boldi'>to save you all the effort</span> of having to make your own notes as you work through the charts and other data on the PIC's. </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Collating and documenting all the soccer prediction data for you in that way leaves you free to drink in the pictorial stuff on the PIC's, and so <span class='redin'>you will have more time to spend considering and comparing all the relevant data for the soccer matches you are particularly interested in.</span>  </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>The "Blank" EASE allows you to <span class='bluen'>insert up to six different fixtures into a "Selections" box</span>, along with the score-lines you feel would be most appropriate. All the Probabilities and Reliabilities data for both teams in each match is then automatically brought through to the main page for you to see, including all the relevant Odds data (don't worry - <span class='bluen'>it's all pre-coded</span> to enable this to happen automatically, without you having to do anything else at all). </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0;font-size:16px;'><b>So, using the "Blank" EASE spreadsheet, you can very quickly test as many matches as you want to until you find those soccer predictions you would be happy to bet on.</b></p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>Of course, we give you a full explanation as to how to interpret all the soccer predictions data we present. So having the output from our computerised soccer prediction program is <span class='bluei'>just like having your very own computer program</span> (except that we do all the hard work for you).  </p>

<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0'>And if you are at all worried about the possibility of not being able to figure out how to use our spreadsheets, we will take the time to respond to you personally to help you grasp all the fundamentals!  </p>



<p style='margin-top:12px;padding-top:0;font-size:16px;'><b>Now, isn't a soccer prediction service like ours exactly what you need right now?</b></p>
