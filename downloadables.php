<p class='bb'>Blank "EASE" Spreadsheets</p>

<p>To assist you to make your own "best 6" betting selections, we provide a <span class='bb'>downloadable</span> <b>Blank "EASE" Spreadsheet</b> (where "EASE" stands for "Express Advisory Service").  It was devised principally to allow you to select your own 6 matches for Correct Scores "hedge betting" purposes, but it can be used equally as well for 1X2, Double Chance, Win Only or even Asian Handicap selections.  </p>

<p>It has its own database attached, which contains the principal output from our PaW Program.  Yes, it's complicated to use - but you don't have to use it at all if you don't wish to.  It's there for the real experts amongst us.  But if you wish to give it a try, full instructions as to how to use it are contained in another menu under the "Services Information" menu (<b>Using the "Blank" EASE Spreadsheet</b>).  </p>


<p>To save time for the really busy people, we also provide a <b>completed</b> (filled out) "EASE" spreadsheet each week with our own preferred selections on board, so that you can see if there is anything you like from amongst what we have posted or whether you fancy some changes to what we have selected. We will have done the hard work of comparing all available options and selecting what we think is best, and all you need to do is verify/challenge our findings.</p>


<p class='bb'>Exotic Betting Spreadsheets</p>

<p>For those who like exotic bets (multiple alternative bets from the same pool of matches), we provide a suite of worksheets in a downloadable Excel file.  They have some interesting names, some of which we invented, and they are fun to use, even if it's only "pretend" betting to see how each variant operates while you get the hang of them! </p>

<p class='bb'>Plateau Staking Plan</p>

<p>For those who would like to modify their betting stakes in line with increasing betting returns, we also provide a downloadable Excel file that has one such spreadsheet application, which we call the <b>"Plateau Staking Plan"</b>.  Feel free to download it and give it a try!</p>
