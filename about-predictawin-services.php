<p><span class='bb' style='color:purple'><i>Introduction:</i></span></p>

<p>
<i>[Note: <b>We are not tipsters</b> and we do not pretend to be; we offer a unique data and information based service, which is the output from our very own in-house computer Program, and which we have linked to Odds that we have collected from the Bookies (very often, done manually).  We do not take bets of any sort, and neither do we advise anyone to place bets, although we may provide information as to what we ourselves might be betting on or avoiding betting on (as the case may be). No matter what status of membership you enjoy, you shall therefore be deemed to be solely responsible for whatever it is you decide to do with the data/information we provide you with on this website.]</i>

<br /><br />
This is a <strong>membership website</strong> where, each week, we post the current week's soccer predictions data for access by our <strong>Subscribing  Members</strong> from within the <strong>Members Area</strong>.  If you are not a Subscribing Member you will only be able to see the earlier weeks' matches for the current season, but not the current week's predictions.</p>

<p><em>The Home Page you see each time you access this website is not the Members Area; to get to the current week's data in the Members Area you must click on the Members Log-In button at the top right-hand of the Home Page screen and then log in.  Once logged in, the original Home Page will not be accessible anymore, since its primary purpose is simply to focus the new visitors' attention on what this website has to offer, without being swamped by the "information overload" that might occur if they were presented on the Home Page with all the menus that sit inside the Members Area.</em>  </p>

<p>To ensure that we post worthwhile predictions that have the same underlying data "consistency", we have produced our very own unique piece of software, which we call the <strong>"Predict-A-Win" Program</strong> (the <strong>"Paw" Program</strong>).  It produces a vast array of essential backup data for posting alongside the base predictions, and which will help you to <strong>make better soccer betting selections</strong>, whether you are an expert or a novice.
</p>
		
<p>We provide soccer predictions and backup data for the following Premier Divisions:</p>


<ol style="list-style-type:none;padding:0;margin:0px;margin-left:60px;padding-top:10px;font-weight: bold;">
	<li class='ddarrow3'>for Europe:<br/>
	<div class='bb' style='padding-bottom:0px;padding-left:20px;'><B><I>England, France, Germany, Greece, Holland, Italy, Portugal, Scotland, Spain and Turkey</I></B></div></li><br />

	<li class='ddarrow3'>for the Americas: <br />
	<div class='bb' style='padding-left:20px;'><I><B>Brazil (Serie A and B) and the USA (MLS)  </B></I></div></li>

</ol>

<p>Plus we cover <span class='bb'>3 English</span> and <span class='bb'>3 Scottish</span> <span class='bb' style='color:purple'>Middle </span> Divisions, <span class='bb'>4 English</span> <span class='bb' style='color:purple'>Minor</span> Divisions and <span class='bb'>Brazil's</span> <span class='bb' style='color:purple'>Serie B</span>.</p>

<p><i>[So that our analytical data can be truly useful to our Members, we analyse and compare our predictions data on a "seasonal" basis.  We therefore keep the postings for the European and Americas Divisions completely separate, because the timings of the soccer seasons for Europe and the Americas are so very different from each other.]   </i></p>



<p><span class='bb' style='color:purple'><i>Membership Registration Requirement:</i></span></p>

<p>Only <strong>Subscribing Members</strong> will be able to get the current week's prediction data, although visitors and non-paying Registered Members (of which there will be over 5,000) will still be able to see the Home Page "Freebie" predictions and all past "historical" predictions data right up to the end of the previous week.</p>



<p><span class='bb' style='color:purple'><i>Focus of Our Online Services:</i></span></p>

<p>Our aim on this website is to provide soccer predictions data that will give our Members <strong>the best possible chance of beating the Bookie</strong> on a regular basis and <strong>making extra money each season</strong>.</p>


<p>Although we primarily concentrate on 1X2 predictions, <strong>we also like to work with Correct Scores betting</strong>, because we feel it offers a good chance of being able to <strong>hit the jackpot</strong>, <span class='red'>whereas standard 1X2 betting never could!</span>  </p>


<p>It's true that a Correct Scores jackpot would never be as high as the jackpots you could get on most <strong>National Lotteries</strong>, but there <strong>your chances are only 1 in 13.8 million</strong>, whereas with Correct Scores betting <strong>you can reduce the odds against you to just about 1 in 200,000</strong> in some cases, with the chance of earning around <strong>50,000 units back for each unit laid out!</strong>  </p>


<p><strong>With 1X2 betting, the AVERAGE Bettor loses about 50% of his</strong> (and some even 100%, sometimes long before the season is over).  However, <strong>our predictions data should help to cure that problem for the thinking novice!</strong>  <span class='red'>But for the lazy guys and gals we won't be much help - and that's a fact!</span> </p>

<p>To assist you in understanding our Program's predictions we give you <strong>a phenomenal range of analytical tools</strong> (such as our very useful <a class="prv" href="team-performance-chart-last.php">Team Performance Records</a> and all the backup data associated with them), which enables you (i) to check out our tips "on the day" and (ii) to decide for yourself whether you wish to stick with your own selections or accept our Program's predictions. </p>


<p>To be truly useful to our members, we have gone one step further and produced a unique, online, interactive <strong>Soccer Predictions Analysis Tool</strong> (which we simply call <strong>"SoccerPAT"</strong>).  It is so very easy to use (well, we worked hard to make sure it was), and once you have seen its potential and mastered how to get the best out of it, <strong>you will wonder how you ever managed without it!</strong>  We have already produced <b>some short videos</b>  showing you how to use it (the links can be found on this website), and more videos will follow in due course to show a few tricks we have found.    </p>

	
<p>If nothing else, our soccer prediction data should enable you to very easily validate your own assessment of the likelihood of the match outcomes. But the quality of our backup data is such that <strong>your prediction ability cannot fail to be improved if you make the most of what we post!</strong></p>




<p><span class='bb' style='color:purple'><i>Cautionary Advice:</i></span></p>



<p>Of course, we can't give any guarantees or warranties of any sort as to the reliability or otherwise of our predictions, even though certain postings may represent our "Prime" selections. This is because betting is a very uncertain business and therefore highly risky; the "Goliaths" get toppled by the "Davids" far too often for our liking.  </p>

<p>Also, please bear in mind that something that worked well for you (or us) in the previous season may not do as well in the current season, so please do check out what is happening this season before you start losing money on a plan that no longer works!</p>


<p>In view of the foregoing you are therefore deemed to be solely responsible for any betting losses you may incur. Specifically, you are strongly advised not to rely simply and solely upon information and data found on this website but to <strong>do your own legwork</strong> to research and test the validity or otherwise of our predictions. In this regard, you will be deemed to have read and accepted our <a class='prv' href='../disclaimer.php'>Disclaimer</a>. </p>

<p>And finally, watch out for the many online scammers who try to woo you by pointing to the high percentages they achieve for their winning picks, but who fail to provide you with <strong>actual "cash winnings" details</strong> such as we show.  That's because they don't want to tell you that their 92% winners lost them 2% or more of their Betting Base Bank!</p>  

<p>When you factor in how much those scammers charge you per pick, you can see that you would need to lay out hundreds (if not thousands) to cover their services charges, so your eventual losses would be much greater than the base 2% - and probably nearer 50-60%!  So please don't get caught out!  There is no easy ride to making money at soccer betting, and those scammers are just playing to the gullible amongst us!    
</p>


<p>We therefore caution you that you should always bet wisely <b><i>(meaning, never bet with more money than you can afford to lose)</b></i>. If you have any problems in this regard and would like some help to control your betting habit, please visit the following link for assistance: </p>
